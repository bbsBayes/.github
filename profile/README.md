# Welcome!

This is the organization for the bbsBayes project. Here is where we keep the work related to our R packages for conducting hierarchical Bayesian analysis of North American breeding bird survey data.

Current we have two packages

- [bbsBayes](https://github.com/bbsBayes/bbsBayes) - The original and now obsolete version, uses JAGS for the modelling - NOT Available on CRAN
- [bbsBayes2](https://github.com/bbsBayes/bbsBayes2) - The new version, available on the bbsBayes R-universe, uses Stan for the modelling
